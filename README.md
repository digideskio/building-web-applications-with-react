I am a married man. 

I can almost hear the disappointed _oohs_ and _aahs_ in the audience, but that's not what I came here to talk about. I am a married man _and_ I have a father-in-law.

He is a semi-retired mechanical engineer and his spare-time hobby is building stuff. It may sound too vague, but it's only because this is exactly what he does. He can pass by some discarded office chair or some plywood that was rejected for someone's bird home, stop, think a little and move on. 2 month later, he would present a movable, folding table.

I am quite fond of the guy, but that hobby of his has been my favorite ribbing topic for the last decade or so. There hasn't been a family gathering without it coming up, much to my joy. He takes the laughs in stride too.

Recently, after some very superficial soul searching, I came to the scary conclusion my wife had a while ago - I am just like him. Not by appearance, but by that damn hobby. I, too, build stuff.

Now, me being a software architect by trade, my stuff is bits and pieces of that software, but just like him, the process of actually making them fit is frequently more gratifying that the actual result. Just like him, the parts do not necessarily seem to belong together at first, but seem made for each other in the end.

This book (hopefully) is my attempt to organize these pieces and provide some thinking and a platform for discussion on the matter.

By the way, my father-in-law gets his revenge for my jokes - he gives his creations as a present. To us. Which, as you probably already understand, makes me even more like him - this being an _open-source software_ related book and all.

Hopefully the book won't take as much space on your balcony as the table does on mine.

Enjoy.
