I am a married man. 

I can almost hear the disappointed _oohs_ and _aahs_ in the audience, but that's not what I came here to talk about. I am a married man _and_ I have a father-in-law.

He is a semi-retired mechanical engineer and his spare-time hobby is building stuff out of, well, other stuff. He can pass by some discarded office chair or some plywood, stop, think a little and move on. Then, 2 month later, he would present a movable, folding table.

I am pretty fond of the guy, but that hobby of his has been my favorite ribbing topic for the last decade or so. There hasn't been a family gathering without it coming up, much to my joy. He takes the laughs in stride too.

Recently, after some superficial soul searching, I came to the scary conclusion my wife had a while ago - I am just like him. Not by appearance, but by that damn hobby. I, too, build stuff.

I am a software architect by trade and my stuff is bits and pieces of that software. Just like him, the process of actually making them fit is frequently more gratifying that the actual result. Just like him, the parts do not necessarily seem to belong together at first, but seem made for each other in the end.

This book (hopefully) is my attempt to organize my approach to making these parts fit.

By the way, my father-in-law always gets his revenge - he gives his creations out as presents. To us. Which makes us even more alike - this being an _open-source software_ related book and all.

Hopefully the book won't take as much space on your balcony as the table does on mine.

Enjoy.
